# Evolutionary AI for TORCS
An evolutionary AI based on MarI/O AI created and tested as a TORCS Bot driver. Uses the [SCR Championship model](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cig/files/SCR%20Championship/) as a compilation and running method.

This project was created as a Robotics course final project.
